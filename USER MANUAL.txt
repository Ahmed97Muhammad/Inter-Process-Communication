*** USER MANUAL ***

This project contains three parts:

1.IPC using filing:

to run this you need to compile two files which are:

1.filewrite.c
2.fileread.c

open terminal in linux and type the following commands:
1. gcc -o fileuser filewrite.c  ( for compiling)
2. ./fileuser ( for executing)

Then open another another terminal and type following commands:
1. gcc -o fileread fileread.c  ( for compiling)
2. ./fileread  ( for executing)


2. IPC using pipes:

to run this you need to compile the following file:

pipes.c

open terminal in linux and type the following commands:
1. gcc -o pipes pipes.c ( for compiling)
2. ./pipes ( for executing)



3. IPC using pipes by mkfifo command:

to run this you need to compile two files which are:

1.mkfiforead.c
2.mkfiforwrite.c

open terminal in linux and type the following commands:
1. gcc -o mkforead mkforead.c  ( for compiling)
2. ./mkforead ( for executing)

Then open another another terminal and type following commands:
1. gcc -o mkfiforwrite.c mkfiforwrite.c  ( for compiling)
2. mkfiforwrite.c  ( for executing)


4. IPC using semaphores:

to run this you need to compile the following file:

semaphores.c
open terminal in linux and type the following commands:
1. gcc -o semaphores -lpthread semaphores.c
2. ./semaphores


IMPORTANT NOTE :
